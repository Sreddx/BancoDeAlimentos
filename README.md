# Banco de Alimentos de Guadalajara Mobile app
This mobile application was created in order to help the BAMX(Food bank of Mexico) increase the amount of donations that people made by creating a feed with the banks achieviements as well as relevant information of goals, places people could directly donate food as well as google maps and paypal integrations. 

### My contribution
I worked on the integration of paypal and google maps within the app as well as some front end views. This included the donations view that allowed users to input an amount that they wanted to donate and then directly donate said amount through paypal. The donations would be reflected on the backend and on the goals tab that all users could see. Apart from this I also worked on the map view that showed users the places the food bank could receive food donations.
